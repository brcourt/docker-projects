##IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT TRAPPING SIGNALS##
1. Trap won't execute until the current process finishes execution, so if we simply had sleep 1000, we wouldn't trap anything before the STOP_TIMEOUT (or when the subsequent SIGKILL is sent). To work around this, we background sleep and use "wait $!" to interrupt. This way, we can capture the signal. Since the container dies with PID 1, the background sleep process will terminate as well (normally, the backgrounded process will not be terminated unless the trap its process it as well).

2. Only PID 1 will receive the signal from docker stop. This is important based on how your command is structured in your Dockerfile. If you have `CMD /script.sh` (shell form) in your Dockerfile, the interpreted command will be `/bin/sh -c /script.sh`. This will fork a process to run the script on and this new process will never receive the signal. Instead, use `CMD ["/script.sh"]' `exec form). This will run the script as PID 1 and allow the script to capture signals.
